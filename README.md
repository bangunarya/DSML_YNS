# Yayasan Nusantara Sejati Course on Data Science and Machine Learning
This repository contains lecture notes and simple python implementations prepared for a project by Yayasan Nusantara Sejati to help develop data science and machine learning course materials for students in the 3T (Terluar, Tertinggal, Terdepan) area (isolated and left-behind regions) in Indonesia. However, the project was postponed and I decided to put it in github repository instead so that Indonesian students can read and learn the python implementation.
